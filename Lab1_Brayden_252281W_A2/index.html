                <p>Players are given 2 chances/rolls to knock down all the pins on each turn.</p>
                <p>Players would recieve a Strike when they knock down all 10 pins with a single ball, or a spare when they knock down all 10 pins with 2 balls</p>
                <p>Bowling is played by over 120 million people in more than 90 countries, including 70 million people in the United States alone.</p>

                    <h1 >A Brief History of Bowling</h1>
                    <p>The earliest known forms of bowling date back to ancient Egypt, 
                    with wall drawings depicting bowling being found in a royal Egyptian tomb dated to 3200 BCE.</p>
                    <p>Balls were made using the husks of grains, covered in a material such as leather, 
                        and bound with string. Other balls made of porcelain were also found.</p>
                    <p>A similar game evolved between Roman legionaries, about 2000 yers ago, entailing the tossing of stone objects as 
                        close as possible to other stone objects, which eventually evolved into outdoor bowling.</p>
                    <p>In 1299, the oldest-surviving known bowling green for target style bowling was built: Master's Close, in Southampton, England, which is still in use.</p>   
                    <p>In 1511, King Henry VII banned bowling for the lower classes and limited the use of private lanes to the wealthy.</p>
                    <p>In 1848, the Scottish Bowling Association for lawn bowling was founded</p>
                    <p>n 1875, the National Bowling Association (NBA) was founded by 27 local clubs in NYC to standardize rules for tenpin bowling but was later superseded in 1895
                        due to failure to agreeing on other rules</p>
                    <p>On 9 September 1895, the modern standardized rules for tenpin bowling were established by the American Bowling Congress (ABC)</p>
                    <p>In the early 1890s, Duckpin bowling was invented in Boston, Massachusetts</p>
